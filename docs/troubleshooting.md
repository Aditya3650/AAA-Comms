**Exiting Vim Without Saving Changes**
<br/>
Vim does not let you quit the program and go back to CMD without saving your changes first. When you havenâ€™t saved your changes and when you enter `:q` control command to quit Vim, Vim shows a warning message and it does not let you quit the program. In order to solve this issue type an exclamation symbol after the `:q` command like this `:q!` To quit the program.

<br/>
**Existing Git Account**
<br/>
If you have already a Git account installed, you will not be able to perform the steps in this guide. You must first uninstall Git to be able to follow the steps in this guide. Please refer to the following [link](https://www.revouninstaller.com/preview-log/?pid=9665&pname=Git) to uninstall Git from your machine.

<br/>
**Different Default Text Editor**
<br/>
If you have changed the default text editor on your Windows machine from Notepad to another text editor, you must change the default text editor back to your notepad. To do so, please refer to this [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-default-programs-in-windows-e5d82cad-17d1-c53b-3505-f10a32e1894d).

**CMD Not Opening/Working**
